This repository contains the analysis code used for the project: 
Theta rhythmicity governs the timing of behavioral and hippocampal responses in humans specifically during memory-dependent tasks (in preparation),

The preprint for this project will become available in the near future, as will the dataset, so check back here soon!

The results were also presented as a poster at CNS 2020 (poster G183), titled 'Oscillatory patterns in behavioral and hippocampal responses during an associative memory task'.

## Prerequisites
MATLAB (The MathWorks) - The code has been tested on Matlab versions between R2018a and R2018b.

## Getting started
Download the .zip and unzip or clone to your favourite path.
Make sure you Matlab path is set to include the code.

Download the relevant data and adjust the paths in the scripts to point to the data.
You are ready to run the code!

You can of course also use the O-score function on your own data. Any time series can be entered into the O-score function, for details on how to set the configuration please refer to the file oscillationScore.m.
